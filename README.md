# speakerRecognitionWithLabView

In this project i make a audio password checker using labview

Recognition and verification of speaker is done using MATLAB scripts but the backend and front of this application developed using labView.

Voice Recognition
You work for a security firm and have been tasked with designing a voice-based
security system that can recognize a person's voice and provide access if it is
correct. As a result, the purpose of this research is to build a security system based
on people's voices. In the Lab View software environment, you must develop a
program to use a person's voice (both previously recorded and presently being
captured) as a password. The user says his name with his voice in this manner, and
if the user's speech pattern is already recorded in the system and has access
authorization, the user says his name with his voice in this manner.
1. You must use your voice as a password.
2. To start saying the voice password, you must use a button and continue
recording until the mouse presses the button, after which the processing
process begins.
3. Display the recorded sound in your programâ€™s main window.
4. If the voice password was incorrect, show the user a message (message box),
and the user can enter their voice again by pressing the cancel key.
5. Your application must include a section for adding a new voice password that
is only accessible with the previous voice password and a 4-digit numeric PIN
code.
6. You can use any theory you want, but you must know it well and be able to
explain it.
7. For this project, you are required to prepare a detailed report of your work
along with the code.
8. For this project you must design a good user interface.
